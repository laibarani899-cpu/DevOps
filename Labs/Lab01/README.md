Lab 01: GitHub Identity, Student Portal Registration, and Ubuntu Server Installation
Lab Objective
In this lab, you will create and correctly configure your GitHub account, register yourself in the Student Marks Portal, install Ubuntu Server in VMware Workstation Pro, verify your required Linux identity, and connect to the server remotely from Windows.

Important Identity Requirement
Your identity must remain consistent throughout this lab:

Enter your complete actual name in your GitHub profile.
Choose a professional GitHub username related to your actual name.
Use the same GitHub account to sign in to the Student Marks Portal.
Enter your actual registration number, course code, and section in the portal.
Use your exact GitHub username as your Ubuntu username.
Use ubuntu as the Ubuntu server name.
Your Ubuntu terminal prompt must follow this pattern:

<github-username>@ubuntu:~$
For example, if the GitHub username is waqassaleem97, the terminal prompt should be:

waqassaleem97@ubuntu:~$
Required Folder Structure
The README.md file and the instructional images are provided by the instructor. You must create the screenshots directory and prepare your own Lab1_Solution.pdf.

Your completed Lab 01 directory must follow this structure:

DevOps/
└── Labs/
    └── Lab01/
        ├── README.md
        ├── Lab1_Solution.pdf
        └── screenshots/
            └── (screenshots of your completed tasks)
Follow these rules:

Save every screenshot of your work inside Labs/Lab01/screenshots/.
Use the exact screenshot filenames specified in this README.
Create Lab1_Solution.pdf yourself after completing the lab.
Add your screenshots to Lab1_Solution.pdf in the same order as the tasks.
The Grade Approved Students GitHub Actions workflow checks the screenshots directory, not the images embedded only in the PDF.
